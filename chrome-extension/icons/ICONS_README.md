# Icons

This project uses PNG icons referenced by `chrome-extension/manifest.json`:

- `public/icon16.png`
- `public/icon48.png`
- `public/icon128.png`

These satisfy Chrome extension icon requirements for toolbar, extension manager, and store listing metadata.

## Update Guidance

If you replace icons:

1. Keep exact filenames and dimensions
2. Use PNG format
3. Ensure you own the artwork or have commercial rights
4. Rebuild and verify icons appear in `dist/public/`
